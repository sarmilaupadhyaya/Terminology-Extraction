Abstract Multiword Expressions MWEs are a frequently occurring phenomenon found in all natural languages that is of great importance to linguistic theory natural language processing applications and machine translation systems . Neural Machine Translation NMT architectures do not handle these expressions well and previous studies have rarely addressed MWEs in this framework . In this work we show that annotation and data augmentation using external linguistic resources can improve both translation of MWEs that occur in the source and the generation of MWEs on the target and increase performance by up to BLEU points on MWE test sets . We also devise a MWE score to specifically assess the quality of MWE translation which agrees with human evaluation . We make available the MWE score implementation along with training sets and lists of MWEs for reproduction and extension . Keywords: multiword expressions neural machine translation evaluation 1 . Introduction Multiword Expressions MWEs are a pervasive phenomenon in all natural languages to the point that according to some studies they represent approximately half of a language s lexicon Jackendoff 1995 . They also challenge NLP applications because of their often unpredictable and behaviour Villavicencio et 2005 . We call a MWE an expression that is composed of two or more words working as a unit with respect to some levels of linguistic analysis Calzolari et 2002 a MWE displays idiosyncratic properties that cannot be explained solely on the basis of regular syntactic and semantic rules Everaert et 2014 and is generally characterised by some degree of conventionality Baldwin and Kim 2010 Constant et 2017 . In the last few years Neural Machine Translation NMT has proved the best performing framework compared to previous methodologies with neural architectures producing ever more target language . Even so NMT output is sometimes a poor translation of the source sentence Nguyen and Chiang 2018 and it is therefore important to investigate specific linguistic phenomena and improve translation quality not only in terms of standard measurements . Previously dominant and Statistical Machine Translation SMT techniques Koehn et 2007 et 2016 naturally take into account phrasal components and there has been significant research on MWEs in these frameworks however for NMT due to a lack of phrasal segmentation it is less obvious how to address specific language phenomena such as MWEs . Moreover while standard metrics are effective in terms of system comparison their ability to account for more improvements in MT is less straightforward et 2006 and their effectiveness has been questioned . Therefore evaluating the performance of NMT architectures in translating MWEs remains an open challenge . The aim of this study is to empirically verify whether integrating information on MWEs either through targeted training examples or through explicit annotation in the target language can help disambiguating between simple phrasal units and expressions and thus be beneficial to NMT . In our first approach we try augmenting our training data with entries from a bilingual and a monolingual MWE dictionary adding a relatively small number of instances 10 and 2 of the original data respectively both in isolation and in their sentence context from usage examples provided . The second approach takes a MWE annotation tool and labels MWEs on the source . We either concatenate MWE into one word or we use factors to indicate if they form part of a MWE . We show that for a test set comprised of genuinely noncompositional MWEs the NMT output is of extremely low quality indicating that these models struggle to handle these examples especially in the small training data condition . We also show that all our methods improve translation in general and MWE translation in particular . The method of including MWE in context with backtranslation to recreate the source side does well in the low resource setting but given the small number of genuine examples is not scalable . Our approach of labelling MWEs does however extend to improving translation in a large resource experiment . In order to further analyse our results we propose a novel evaluation metric the that specifically evaluates how well MWEs on the source side are translated . It needs a test set with human annotated MWEs on the source and their translation in the reference . It uses the Levenshtein distance to find the closest matching word in the hypothesis and rewards partial matches at the character level . We compare our novel metric with manual evaluation and show that it agrees with human judgments . In this paper we limit our study to one language pair from English to Italian and to one specific neural architecture but our methods can easily be extended to other language combinations or different NMT frameworks . We also rely on human curated resources in order to prove their value to NMT and in future work we plan to consider automatically extracted MWE lexicons and unsupervised taggers . 3817 2 . Related work While most work focussing on MWEs in MT has been within the context of and statistical machine translation systems there have however been recent papers addressing MWEs in an NMT framework . Some use general knowledge about phrasal structures to improve translation such as Tang et al . 2016 for example who improve translation by symbolically encoding phrasal candidates on the source side and allowing the decoder to output more than one word at a time for source phrases . While they focus on fixed expressions such as named entities names places numbers in our experiment we address virtually all MWE categories . Few recent studies also propose methods to integrate explicit information on MWEs in the context of NMT . For example Rikters and Bojar 2017 use parallel MWE candidates on the source side automatically extracted from preprocessed text and employ them as additional training data method 1 and extract parallel sentences featuring the MWEs selected in 1 as additional training examples method 2 . Our first method Section . is inspired by their first best performing one but while they use standard toolkits for MWE extraction an approach that is affected by the accuracy of the selected tool and by noise of the data we aim to minimize false positives by using a manually compiled bilingual dictionary to select the MWE candidates on the source side . Other studies exploit monolingual data to learn a better language model and integrate it into the decoder Gulcehre et 2015 . Monolingual data in the target language are paired with synthetic on the source side Edunov et 2018 and this new is used as additional training text . This method is effective in improving translation quality as described in Sennrich et al . 2016a outperforming results for . Our second method . is inspired by these approaches which we extend by applying them specifically to MWEs . Most studies focussing on MWE translation evaluation aim to evaluate how well the MWEs identified in the source text are translated into the target language . This involves i identifying the MWEs in the source text ii identifying their translation in the target text iii evaluating the translation quality based on criteria such as adequacy full partial etc . and fluency fluent disfluent etc . Ramisch et 2013 . The first two tasks are usually completed by MWE extraction tools and automatic alignment the third is usually carried out via manual inspection of the output translation . When not evaluated in terms of accuracy over a manually compiled gold standard Monti et 2015 translation quality is evaluated through standard measures such as BLEU Papineni et 2002 and METEOR Denkowski and Lavie 2014 or chrF PopoviÄ‡ 2015 but none of them specifically addresses the translation of MWEs although metrics have similarities to our proposed measure as we will discuss in Section . 3 . Background . Neural machine translation The neural machine translation toolkit used in all our experiments Nematus Sennrich et 2017 implements a architecture with attention similar to the model described by Bahdanau et al . 2015 . The Encoder consists of two single recurrent neural networks RNNs one encoding the input forward from left to right the other backward from right to left so that all the context from the input is available at each time step not only the preceding words and the hidden state of a word is represented by the concatenation of these hidden states . In the implementation we employ in all our experiments training is performed by minimization on the parallel training corpus with Adam Kingma and Ba 2014 a variant of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm . Periodic validation is performed on smoothed BLEU Chen and Cherry 2014 and early stopping on this metric is applied for training stabilization . . Integrating input features: factored NMT In order to allow to specify for arbitrary linguistic input features for each word in the methods we describe in Sections and we represent the encoder input as a concatenation of input features as originally proposed by Sennrich and Haddow 2016 . The idea is that for each feature a separate embedding vector is created and all feature vectors are then concatenated to form a factored representation of the input word whose length is equal to the total embedding size . This is done for an arbitrary number of input features according to the equation 1 j tanh k 1 where k is vector concatenation Ek is a feature embedding matrix Kk is the vocabulary size of input feature k and are weight matrices . 4 . Evaluation methods . BLEU score For general translation evaluation we use detokenized casesensitive BLEU score Papineni et 2002 as implemented in the script of the Moses toolkit Koehn et 2007 . The BLEU score measures the overlap between the translation hypothesis and the reference translation and somewhat correlates with human judgements however it has a host of known limitations et 2006 such as requiring exact matches and poorly managing word order and reorder . . Evaluating MWE translation usually means measuring how well the MWEs featuring the source side are translated into the target . To do this we ideally need to identify the exact extent of MWEs on the source side and align them both with their reference and their hypothesis translations . In practice this can be difficult especially in the NMT framework where we cannot faithfully rely on the attention mechanism as a valid substitute for phrase alignment Ghader and Monz 3818 2017 . To overcome these limitations we devise a metric which does not need phrase alignment only requiring a reference translation of the source MWE as it works on full target sentences1 . We refer to this metric as . Our test sets have identified MWEs on the source side the scope of the evaluation and their reference translations are also identified in the target . We can start by taking each of the words that comprise the reference translation of the MWE and take its closest match in the translated hypothesis according to a distance metric to be its actual translation . We use the standard definition of the Levenshtein distance between two strings a b of length and respectively as leva b where leva b i j max i j if min i j 0 min leva b i 1 j 1 leva b i j 1 1 leva b i 1 j 1 1 ai otherwise . 2 where 1 is 0 when ai bj and 1 otherwise and leva b i j is the distance between the first i characters of a and the first j characters of b . The first element in the min corresponds to deletion from a to b the second to insertion and the third to match or substitution . Specifically for each reference sentence in the test set we take a MWE reference translation of length n comprised of the words x0 . . . xn with word lengths of . . . . For each word in the sequence x0 . . . xn we find the word in the translation hypothesis ymin with the lowest Levenshtein distance then average this over all the MWEs in the sentence to get the for that sentence as described in Equation 3 : 1 levxn ymin n 3 We calculate the for all the sentences in the corpus and divide by the number of sentences to get the score for the entire test set . In our implementation the distance is capped to be at most equal to length of the reference component and being normalised by it ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 1 . From a linguistic viewpoint we are making a strong assumption that the least distant word ymin corresponds to the actual translation of the reference component without looking at its real alignment . While of course this does not hold for all sentences we empirically find that this assumption matches up with manual inspection because it is very unlikely that the items featuring the MWE translation appear elsewhere in the sentence . For instance using this measure on the and reference translations described in Section . yields an almost perfect score of and respectively . The measure considers matches rather than full words . This allows the metric to account for partial matches which are particularly important when translating into highly inflected languages like Italian . In fact a system may be able to correctly detect and translate a MWE but in a different grammatical form or category than it appears 1 However if alignment is available it can work directly with even more precision on the aligned items instead of the whole target sentence . Source he woke up Hyp . si sveglia Reference si Ã¨ svegliato si Ã¨ svegliato si Ã¨ svegliato 1 0 0 Source I rang up Hyp . ho fatto una telefonata Reference ho telefonato ho telefonato ho telefonato 1 0 Table 1: Difference between and wordbased matching . Green indicates correct matches of the hypothesis over the reference string blue scores are normalized by the length of reference string . in the reference which many times may be acceptable and this cannot be accounted for by matches . In Table 1 we report a toy example to explain such intuition: the MWE he woke up is translated by si Ã¨ svegliato lit . himself is woken in the reference translation and si sveglia lit . himself wakes in the hypothesis which is correct as for the choice of the lexical item but incorrect in verb tense . A match would only match the first element . Similarly the MWE I rang up reference: ho telefonato lit . I have phoned is translated as ho fatto una telefonata lit . I have made a phone call which is a correct translation and would be over penalized by a metrics . On the contrary the is able to smooth these effects by awarding higher partial credit for the matching strings . Another advantage of this approach is that although our metric requires specifically annotated test corpora it is able to focus on MWEs while traditional metrics such as the BLEU score or even methods such as chrF PopoviÄ‡ 2015 are far less sensitive to improvements in MWE translation specifically . . Human evaluation Finally we ask 4 expert human annotators to evaluate the quality of the translation of 100 MWEs identified in our set described in Section . which we compare with the results given by our proposed . Annotators are provided with the source sentences with one identified MWE for each sentence a reference translation for each sentence with the identified translation of the MWE and the systems output for each sentence . We ask annotators to focus on the translation of the identified MWE only and evaluate it for each sentence in each system on a scale from 1 to 5 considering a idiomaticity whether the idiomatic meaning of the source MWE has been correctly identified b grammaticality and c fluency . Reference translation is given as benchmark but we ask annotators to also consider alternative correct translations as valid . Like each of our selected automatic measures we do not distinguish between these linguistic aspects in a manner and ask annotators to express one 3819 single score for each sentence for each system . Finally we average each system s sentence scores to get evaluation . 5 . Data description . Training and development sets As a baseline for our translation experiments in a low resource setting described in Sections . we use the parallel corpus released for the IWSLT Evaluation Campaign 2014 composed of translated sentences from the TED conferences transcripts and available from the W IT3 Web Inventory Cettolo et 2014 . As a baseline for our last experiment Section . we combine the above corpus with the section of the Europarl parallel corpus 2012 v7 release Koehn 2005 which consists of parallel sentences from the proceedings of the European parliament . We use the available parallel corpus for development dev sentences . . Test sets We evaluate our models on three separate test sets . The first is the annotated corpus made available by Monti et al . 2015 consisting of parallel EnglishItalian sentences from TED talks transcripts but not included in our training sets . This corpus is manually annotated for MWEs and to the best of our knowledge it represents the most comprehensive bilingual resource for the pair . Each manually annotated MWE on the English source side which can be of any grammatical type is aligned with its reference translation into the target language Italian which we use in our evaluation metric Section . and the reference translation may or may not be in turn a MWE . In total the English side the corpus presents 880 different MWE types over a total of 2066 MWE instances the majority of which are continuous 91 . MWE length spans from 2 to 7 words the majority featuring either 2 or 3 words . The criteria according to which the corpus has been annotated are such that phrases like there are expect to or and so are annotated as valid MWEs but a stricter definition of would classify them as collocations or frequent compositional combinations of words . Thus in order to specifically target idiosyncratic MWEs in our experiments we construct a second test set using the example sentences of a manually compiled bilingual dictionary the Il Ragazzini dictionary of Ragazzini 2019 . The example sentences are complete sentences that are presented to the reader in order to exemplify a lemma an expression or a specific use of a word . We collect parallel sentences connected to expressions that in the dictionary have been marked as MWEs by professional lexicographers . Some of these example sentences along with the MWE and their translation are reported in Table 2 . Finally we randomly select a subset of these sentences 100 sentences and annotate them for MWEs similarly to how was done in the corpus by Monti et al . 2015 . Annotation is partially done automatically by matching the lexical items in the sentence with the lemmatized MWE and its translation as reported in the dictionary then manually to correct errors . We call this subset and use it to evaluate our results with the metric which requires identification of the MWE reference translations and for human evaluation . Lemma MWE Example sentence Translation short come short of the result has come short of our expectations il risultato ha deluso le nostre speranze sweet sweet spot they re struggling to find the sweet spot in the market stanno faticando a trovare la collocazione giusta sul mercato Table 2: Example sentences from the test set which has a more rigorous definition of with the indication of the lemma and the MWE featuring in them as originally reported in the Il Ragazzini dictionary . . Data preprocessing We preprocess all datasets by applying tokenization and truecasing using the Moses toolkit Koehn et 2007 . In order to limit the size of the training vocabulary and to achieve translation we use encoding Sennrich et 2016b by jointly learning and applying BPE on both source and target sides with 32K merge operations and apply it with vocabulary threshold 1 meaning that when BPE each subword must have been seen at least once at training time and is otherwise replaced by the UKN symbol . 6 . Experiments In this section we describe four methods to integrate knowledge from existing lexicographic resources into an NMT framework . We do this in a setting by augmenting our training instances with artificial parallel data specifically targeting MWEs in the source . or in the target language . by identifying existing MWEs on the source side and symbolically encode them as single tokens . or through a factored representation along with more linguistic information . Finally we scale the last most flexible method to a setting . . Baseline training and settings We train a translation model from English into Italian using an recurrent neural architecture with attention and gated recurrent units . Since our aim is not that of achieving state of the art results but rather improve performance in NMT regardless of the particular experimental setting we use a shallow architecture one bidirectional layer for the encoder and one single layer for the decoder 3820 with the following parameters which we do not optimize following Sennrich and Haddow 2016: embedding layer size 512 hidden layer size 1024 training minibatches size 80 beam size 12 maximum sentence length 50 dropout with probability . We train for about 1 day using as our objective loss function we sort sentences by length and we shuffle them at each epoch . We calculate BLEU score every iterations and apply early stop when we see no improvement on the development set for at least 10 checks . . Data augmentation . MWE dictionary In our first method which we refer to as we use linguistic knowledge about MWEs from a traditional lexicographic resource and augment our training data with additional lemmatized from a manually compiled source . This is the section of the Il Ragazzini bilingual dictionary Ragazzini 2019 which we use in its latest version . In the dictionary each MWE receives several translations often synonyms or near synonyms separated by a semicolon which we preprocess by splitting them into separate training examples . In order to get the MWE candidates we extract all the lemmas which contain a whitespace and have therefore been classified as idiosyncratic lexical items with a word status because they have their own dictionary entry but are composed of two or more words . The majority of these expressions are verbal especially constructions such as stand at take off etc . secondarily prepositional according to nominal Bach flower remedies and adjectival au pair expressions . Notice that we extract lemmatized forms and pair them with their base form translations which is how they appear in every standard dictionary such as for example the English base verbal form get into and its Italian translation in the present infinitive entrare . In total we cover 3560 different MWE types and obtain parallel MWE tokens after processing which includes splitting the several translations connected to a single MWE into separate instances . We add the so obtained parallel entries to the baseline training set for a total of sentences . we augment the baseline training data with synthetic data by approx . 10 . We learn and apply BPE jointly in both languages with 32K merge operations and train the new model with the hyperparameters described in Section . . MWE in context with backtranslation In this method we aim to improve translation by attending to MWEs in context on the target side . We do so by augmenting the training data with monolingual sentences on the target side that contain at least one MWE in context for each target instance . The hypothesis behind this is that since RNNs are capable of modelling sequence context they should be better at discriminating between MWEs and simple phrases and therefore ensure a better translation quality if exposed to their larger contexts . This approach may also result in overgeneration as it can pair an idiomatic MWE with an incorrect literal translation on the English side nonetheless it should provide the decoder with both correct MWE instances and their contexts which should help the system generate more correct naturally sounding language . Sentences containing MWEs can be extracted from raw text using standard identification techniques Rikters and Skadin a 2016 but in order to ensure that our data contain genuine MWE candidates we extract them from a monolingual dictionary of Italian lo Zingarelli Cannella and Lazzarini a cura di 2019 encoded in XML with a similar schema as the Il Ragazzini used in . The encoding of the dictionary explicitly marks phrasal components with the phr tag and for a selection of them in particular for the most idiosyncratic ones it provides some usage examples in the form of complete sentences . We extract these usage example sentences which therefore contain at least one MWE for a total of 3923 Italian sentences and pair each with its approximated in English obtained by a model with the same hyperparameters setting and data used as the baseline . but in reversed direction from Italian to English . We include the so obtained supplementary data to the original training instances for a total of . we augment the training data by 2 . We jointly learn and apply BPE with 32K merge operations and train the new model with the same hyperparameters as in . . MWE labelling In the following methods we use the identification tool provided by the module of the mwetoolkit Ramisch et 2010 to identify MWEs on the source side . The method requires a list of MWE candidates to be specified in their lemmatized form and uses it to look at each word s lemma in the text to tag it as part of a MWE2 . As a source of lemmatized MWE candidates we exploit the English section of the Il Ragazzini dictionary of which we already employed for Section . There we adopted a strict definition of and only considered the lemma elements that contained a whitespace however in that method the number of MWE candidate type was little more that 3k while here we aim to expand our candidate list in order to identify as many MWEs as possible . Thus we take a more shallow approach and extend the English MWE list already used in by extracting all the elements in the dictionary annotated as phrasal units . These candidates span from a minimum length of 2 words to a maximum of 13 and can pertain to any grammatical category . After constructing the MWE candidate list we use the Natural Language Toolkit NLTK Loper and Bird 2002 to perform POS tagging over all our source training instances . POS annotation is then used by the method in the NLTK module combined with positional features to extract the lemma for each word . Finally we 2 We are aware that more sophisticated methods for MWE identification exist but devising more complex methods of MWE identification would represent a task on its own falling outside the scope of the present study . 3821 feed the lemma and POS information on each lexical item to the script to identify and annotate MWEs on the source text . The method returns a factored representation of the text in Moses style where each word is represented as a chain of features separated by the pipe symbol and words making up the identified MWEs as well at its lemma are joint with an underscore . For example a sentence such as 1 the men were angry and walked off would receive the following annotation : 2 where the first factor indicates the surface form the second the lemma which can be a MWE lemma as and the third the . For the sake of our translation experiments we use such information and encode it in two different ways which we refer to as and a IOB encoding respectively . . approach In a first setting which we use for we take a word with spaces approach and simply encode each MWE as a single word by keeping the original underscore given by the annotation tool whenever a MWE has been identified and discard all remaining linguistic information . In this setting sentence 1 would thus be represented as 3 the men were angry and The intuition behind this is that like subword units named entities semantic roles MWEs represent a single unit spread out onto several symbols and therefore encoding them as a single token may be beneficial to their interpretation . Like in the other methods we use BPE to achieve open vocabulary translation . When learning BPE we do not consider the underscore as a word separator and instead we let the BPE algorithm treat it as a valid character . This has the nice side effect of allowing the algorithm to automatically learn regularities over MWEs too across our dataset . For example if we examine the vocabulary file produced by the BPE learning script we notice that for instance out out and are encoded as different tokens3 meaning that when applying BPE at test time the system will know that they represent three different lexical items and only the latter is part of a MWE providing a simple but effective disambiguation method for these otherwise indistinguishable components . Moreover the fact of encoding as a separate token can potentially allow the system to generalize on different MWEs not seen at training time considering them MWEs if correctly annotated at test time . However as a drawback this simple method does not allow to encode discontinuous MWEs . 3 where and indicate word and subword boundaries respectively We apply the annotation on the dataset learn and apply BPE jointly in both languages with 32K merge operations and train the new model with the same hyperparameters as the baseline . . IOB encoding In a second setting we construct input features and annotate them in Moses factored format as required by our chosen toolkit Nematus . We consider three features: the surface form of a word factor 1 the lemma factor 2 and whether the string in factor 1 is at the beginning inside or outside a MWE . Firstly we discard the POS information from the initial annotation . We keep factor 2 as returned by the annotation method which then reports the or the lemma with underscores . Secondly we split the surface MWE forms into their components and apply BPE on the corpus . For each resulting word or subword unit we indicate whether it is at the beginning B inside I or outside O a MWE in field 3 and copy the word s feature value in factor 2 to all its smaller units . Assuming walked were a rare word sentence 1 would receive the following annotation4 : 4 walk Unlike the approach in which only applies to continuous MWEs this strategy may also apply to discontinuous configurations which however we do not consider in the present study because of the lack of an appropriate identification technique but represents a natural extension of our work see Section . Following recommendations in Sennrich and Haddow 2016 we want to make sure that the improvements over the baseline are not due to an increase in the number of model parameters . Therefore we make sure that the sum of the sizes of the embedding layers for each factor equals the size of the embedding layer as in the baseline 512 . We set embedding size to 300 202 and 10 for factors 1 2 and 3 respectively roughly balancing the sizes of the respective vocabulary but without optimizing for this parameter . We adjust the training script as to specify the number of factors 3 and one vocabulary file for each of them plus the target vocabulary . All other parameters are as in Section . . Factored NMT at scale Finally we aim to improve the translation of MWEs and the general translation quality in a setting by scaling the method used in . to a much bigger training set . The reasons why we choose to scale this particular method and not the best scoring method described above which would have been 4 Notice that under this setting factor 3 is constrained in that B may not be followed by O I may be followed by either I O or B indicating consecutive MWEs notice that more subsequent B s are possible as they may indicate multiple subwords units of the first word of a MWE . 3822 are multiple . Firstly the method used in is necessarily dependent on the training size because data augmentation is likely to have an insignificant effect if it is only by a very small percentage on the contrary we aim to propose a method that is easily scalable to any size of the dataset considering that NMT has proven to reach great improvement with increased training size . Secondly the method used in is the most flexible of all other methods because it can potentially account for discontinuous MWEs . Thirdly while we use a naive MWE identification technique this method has a potential for improvement if more identification methods are applied to the preprocessing of the data . As a baseline for this method which we refer to as Baseline big we learn BPE and train a model with the same hyperparameters as in on the much bigger 2M sentence dataset described in detail in Section . We then apply the processing steps explained in Section . factored MWE representation with IOB notation to this dataset learn and apply BPE and train the model again with the same parameters . We call the system . 7 . Results and discussion In Table 3 we report the results obtained by our systems according to detokenised BLEU score BLEU and human evaluation Hum on the different test sets . As explained in Section and human evaluation on are calculated on the annotated subset identified as . Dataset BLEU BLEU Hum small Dictionary Backtrans . Wordwithsp . big Table 3: Experiment results . The best results on each test set for each setting high and low resource are boldfaced . All proposed methods outperform their baseline with scoring best on every test set according to all metrics in a low resource setting . The improvement on BLEU score generally indicates that under a low resource setting small our methods can make the overall quality of automatic translation better by approx . 1 point in general language and up to 5 points on the MWE targeted test set . In fact while the improvement on the general language is not marked we observe a substantial improvement in both BLEU and in translating the . The extremely low figures for the baseline model on this dataset which are hardly better than random translation indicate that it is particularly hard for the NMT system to translate idiosyncratic genuinely noncompositional MWEs like the ones included in especially when the system is not trained with text similar to that of the test set . As for the higher resource setting big as expected the baseline big model outperforms all models trained on the small dataset . in turn improves the baseline by and BLEU points on the and the datasets respectively indicating that the proposed method is beneficial both on general and MWE translation . This is confirmed by the improvements in the measure by and respectively . The human annotation confirms such improvements over the small and big baselines which are even more marked than in automatic measures . The Pearson correlation between the average system scores of the individual human annotators was found to be high between and as was the correlation between the average of all human scores and on as displayed in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Human evaluation y and x results on the different translation systems . Human evaluation and the generally agree in ranking the systems except for the best performing one in the low resource setting where scored best according to the annotators while automatic metrics favoured . However the difference between the two systems on all test sets are really not marked . We believe that the general agreement between the metric and the human evaluation in measuring the improvement of the systems over the baseline and between each other indicates both that our methods are specifically addressing MWEs and that the is good at capturing how well a system is translating MWEs specifically . In order to further verify that the improvements achieved involve genuinely idiosyncratic expressions and does not pertain to general translation improvement only we carry out manual inspection of several instances of the output . In Table 4 we report some translation examples which we compare both with the baseline and with . In some instances Example 1 where produces a correct translation may capture the overall meaning of the MWE but produce partially incorrect literal translations costo di instead of costo della missing the idiosyncratic combined article la and also produces a wrong agreement between the subject and the past participle cresciuta with feminine instead of 3823 Example 1 Text Source the cost of living has scaled up again Backtrans E il costo di vita Ã¨ cresciuta qui Baseline big il costo della vita Ã¨ diminuito di nuovo la mia il costo della vita Ã¨ diventato sempre piÃ¹ alto Example 2 Text Source I have to account for every penny I spend Backtrans devo discutere con tutti i miei piedi Baseline big devo tenere conto di ogni centesimo devo rendere conto di ogni centesimo Table 4: Manual inspection of example translations for compared to Baseline big and .

On the other hand the baseline mistranslates scaled up with diminuito lit . lowered producing almost the opposite meaning . As exemplified in Example 2 is generally good at identifying MWEs on the source side and produces natural sounding expressions on the target side such as rendere conto di which is in turn a MWE in Italian . 8 . Conclusions and further work In this work we argued that MWEs are a relevant phenomenon in natural languages and that neural machine translation systems do not generally handle them well . We showed that explicitly addressing MWEs can improve translation quality and presented several methods to integrate such information and evaluate results according to different resource availability both in a and in a setting . The datasets we exploited are not freely available neither for Italian nor other languages and we take it as future work to extend this with automatically detected MWEs through toolkits . We evaluated our findings with standard measures and through human judgments . We devised a specific score to assess the quality of MWE translation which unlike previous metrics does not require phrase alignment and which correlates with human judgments . Along with the code used in all the stages of the work we also make available our training sets annotated for MWEs as well as lists of MWEs for reproduction and extension studies5 . In terms of our findings we have shown that in a lowresource setting augmenting the training data with MWEtargeted monolingual text as in the method by as little as 2 proved beneficial both in terms of general translation quality and MWE translation quality specifically . This is congruent with the the fact that NMT architectures perform better when exposed to a larger linguistic context which they can model well and MWEs make no exception in this respect . In our experiments we relied on a monolingual dictionary as a source of text: a 5 Available at natural extension of this method will be using identification techniques on the target language to extract more monolingual data from raw text and augment the training data with that . If monolingual data are not available using synthetic lemmatized MWE pairs as in the method proved less effective than identifying MWEs only on the source side and in some cases hurt translation by producing ungrammatical forms . Thus if only lemmatized lists are available it is advisable to only exploit one side of the lemmatized bitext to train a simple identification method and annotate MWEs on the source . When doing so in a setting annotating MWEs as single tokens as in the approach ensures better results than the IOB tagging methods like the one leveraged in . However a approach is limited to continuous MWEs which do not cover the whole spectrum of the phenomenon and is less likely to scale on a setting . In the method we devised a flexible method for annotating MWEs on the source side which consistently improved general and MWE translation quality and markedly outperformed its baseline according to all metrics . A natural extension of this method will be using a more sophisticated MWE identification method to also include discontinuous MWEs or MWEs appearing in marked configurations such as topicalized or passive forms . In conclusion we believe that efforts should be made in the direction of improving the existing MWE identification systems . Recent approaches have experimented on developing MWE identification methods using neural networks Gharbieh et 2017 Klyueva et 2017 which however are supervised and thus heavily rely on the availability of annotated resources . In the future it may be interesting to verify whether it is possible to automatically induce MWE identification with neural networks in an unsupervised fashion for example modelling the internal compositionality of an expression by embedding it as a whole and compare its vector representation with that of its single components . If such techniques prove successful it may be possible to integrate them into a neural machine translation architecture for instance by making MWE identification part of the training objective . 9 .
